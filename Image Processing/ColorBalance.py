#Color balance 
'''
Write a simple application to change the color balance of an image
by multiplying each color value by a different user-specified constant. If you want to get
fancy, you can make this application interactive, with sliders.
'''

# 1. Do you get different results if you take out the gamma transformation before or after
# doing the multiplication? Why or why not?


# 2. Take the same picture with your digital camera using different color balance settings
# (most cameras control the color balance from one of the menus). Can you recover what
# the color balance ratios are between the different settings? You may need to put your
# camera on a tripod and align the images manually or automatically to make this work.
# Alternatively, use a color checker chart (Figure 10.3b), as discussed in Sections 2.3 and
# 10.1.1.


# 3. If you have access to the RAW image for the camera, perform the demosaicing yourself
# (Section 10.3.1) or downsample the image resolution to get a “true” RGB image. Does
# 3.9 Exercises 195
# your camera perform a simple linear mapping between RAW values and the colorbalanced values in a JPEG? Some high-end cameras have a RAW+JPEG mode, which
# makes this comparison much easier.


# 4. Can you think of any reason why you might want to perform a color twist (Section 3.1.2) on the images? See also Exercise 2.9 for some related ideas.
